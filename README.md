- **Automatic Snapshots**: Snapper automatically creates a snapshot when you install, remove, or make changes to applications.

- **List All Snapshots**: To view all snapshots, run:

  ```bash
  snapper ls
  ```

- **Rollback to a Previous Snapshot**: To revert to a previous snapshot, use:

  ```bash
  sudo snapper rollback <snapper-id>
  ```

  Replace `<snapper-id>` with the ID of the snapshot, which you can find by listing all snapshots.

- **Manually Create a Snapshot**: To create a snapshot manually, use:

  ```bash
  snapper -c root create -d "<Name of the snapshot>"
  ```

  Replace `<Name of the snapshot>` with a descriptive name for the snapshot.

- **Automatic Snapshot Cleanup**: Snapshots older than 7 days are automatically deleted.

- **Access Snapshots via GRUB**: All snapshots are visible in the GRUB menu under "Arch Linux - Snapshots". To restore:

  1. Select the desired snapshot from the GRUB menu.
  2. Press Enter to boot from the snapshot.

  **Note**: Ensure you select the snapshot image in the GRUB menu, not the fallback image.

## üìù Notes

- **Reboot Reminder**: Make sure to reboot your system to apply changes if you chose to reboot later.
- **Use with Caution**: Although SnapRescue aims to protect your system, always ensure you have recent backups before making significant changes.
